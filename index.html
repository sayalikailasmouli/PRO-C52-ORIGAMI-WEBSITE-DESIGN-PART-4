<h2>Origami : Panda
  <br>
  <hr color="black">
       <i>Information:The giant panda has an insatiable appetite for bamboo. A typical animal eats half the day—a full 12 out of every 24 hours—and relieves itself dozens of times 
         a day. It takes 28 pounds of bamboo to satisfy a giant panda's daily dietary needs, and it hungrily plucks the stalks with elongated wrist bones that function rather 
         like thumbs. Pandas will sometimes eat birds or rodents as well.
      <br>
      <br>
      COMMON NAME: Giant Panda

SCIENTIFIC NAME: Ailuropoda melanoleuca
<br>
TYPE: Mammals
<br>
DIET: Omnivore
<br>
AVERAGE LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD: 20 years
<br>
SIZE: 4 to 5 feet
<br>
WEIGHT: 300 pounds
<br>
SIZE RELATIVE TO A 6-FT MAN:

<br>
<br>

Behavior and Habitat:

Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China. These high bamboo forests are cool and wet—just as pandas like it. They may climb as high as 13,000 feet to feed
 on higher slopes in the summer season.Pandas are often seen eating in a relaxed sitting posture, with their hind legs stretched out before them. They may appear sedentary, but 
 they are skilled tree-climbers and efficient swimmers.

 <br>
 <br>

 Breeding and Population:
Giant pandas are solitary. They have a highly developed sense of smell that males use to avoid each other and to find females for mating in the spring. After a five-month pregnancy, 
females give birth to a cub or two, though they cannot care for both twins. The blind infants weigh only 5 ounces at birth and cannot crawl until they reach three months of age.
 They are born white, and develop their much loved coloring later.Improved conservation efforts and better survey methods show an increase in the wild panda population. Hundreds more 
 pandas live in breeding centers and zoos, where they are always among the most popular attractions. Much of what we know about pandas comes from studying these zoo animals, because
  their wild cousins are so rare and elusive.

      Origami : Camel
      <br>
      <hr color="black">

      <a href="http://origami.me/camel/"><img src="camel.png" class="center" style="float: right";/></a>

      <i>Information:Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped snout and a humped back. There are two types of camels: dromedary camels, which have one hump, and Bactrian 
        camels, which have two humps. Camels' humps consist of stored fat, which they can metabolize when food and water is scarce.
        In addition to their humps, camels have other ways to adapt to their environment. They have a third, clear eyelid that protects their eyes from blowing sand. 
        Two rows of long lashes also protect their eyes. Sand up the nose can be a problem, but not for camels. They can shut their nostrils during sand storms. 
        Humans have used camels as a means of transport for thousands of years. They can carry about 375 to 600 lbs. (170 to 270 kilograms) on their backs, according 
        to National Geographic. This earned these beasts of burden a nickname, "ships of the desert." Domestic camels are often the main source of meat, milk and even 
        leather or wool products.
      
        <br>
        <br>

        Size:
       Most camels tower above humans. A Bactrian camel, according to the San Diego Zoo, grows to a shoulder height of 6 feet (1.8 meters) and a body length of 10 feet (3 m). 
       They normally weigh 1,320 to 2,200 lbs. (600 to 1,000 kg) when they are fully grown. Dromedary camels get up to about 6.5 feet (2 m) tall at the shoulder and weigh 880 
       to 1,325 lbs. (400 to 600 kg).

       <br>
       <br>

       Diet:
Camels aren't picky about what they eat. Their thick lips allow them to eat things that most other animals couldn't, such as thorny plants. Camels are herbivores, 
though, so you won't find them eating meat.
Filling up on water, when it's available, is very important for camels. They can drink 30 gallons (113 liters) of water in just 13 minutes. Their bodies rehydrate faster than any 
other mammal.
When there is little food and water, the camel's hump fat releases water; 9.3 grams of fat releases 1.13 grams of water, according to research by the University of Singapore. 

      <br>
      <br>

      Habitat:
The two types of camel are found in different parts of the world. The dromedary camel, also called an Arabian camel, can be found in North Africa and the Middle East. 
The Bactrian camel lives in Central Asia. No matter the type, camels are usually found in the desert, prairie or steppe. Though many people think that camels only live in hot 
climates, they do well in temperature ranges from 20 degrees F (minus 29 degrees C) to 120 degrees F (49 degrees C).

    <br>
    <br>

    Habits:
Camels like to stay together in groups called herds. The herds are led by a dominant male, while many of the other males form their own herd called a bachelor herd. 
 Camels are very social and like to greet each other by blowing in each other's faces.

 <br>
 <br>

 Offspring:
 After a gestation of 12 to 14 months, a mother camel will find a private spot to have her young. Female camels usually only have one baby, but sometimes camels have twins. 
 Baby camels are called calves. The newborn calf is able to walk within 30 minutes, though the two won't rejoin the herd until around two weeks later. Camels become fully mature when
  they are 7 years old. Camels live around 17 years. 

  <br>
  <br>


  Classification/ Taxonomy:
Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) and the domestic Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) were named in 1758 by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus, who only knew of the domestic variety. Wild Bactrian camels (Camelus ferus) were discovered in 1878 by Nikolai Prejevalsky, a Russian geographer who explored Mongolia and Tibet. 

For many years, the wild Bactrian was thought to be a subspecies of the domestic Bactrian. However, in recent years, DNA analysis confirmed that C. ferus was a separate species, according to the San Diego Zoo. The main difference between the two species is that the wild Bactrian has three more chromosome pairs than the domestic Bactrian.

Here is the classification of camels, according to Integrated Taxonomic Information System:

Kingdom: Animalia Subkingdom: Bilateria Infrakingdom: Deuterostomia Phylum: Chordata Subphylum: Vertebrata Infraphylum: Gnathostomata Superclass: Tetrapoda Class: Mammalia Subclass: Theria Infraclass: Eutheria Order: Artiodactyla Family: Camelidae Genus: Camelus Species: 

Camelus bactrianus (Bactrian camel)
Camelus dromedarius (one-humped camel)
Subspecies: 

Camelus bactrianus bactrianus
Camelus bactrianus ferus (wild Bactrian camel)
Conservation status

The wild Bactrian camel is considered critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and has a population that is decreasing. In fact, wild camels are one of the most endangered large mammals. According to the Wild Camel Protection Foundation, there are fewer than 1,000 wild camels alive.

   <b>Facts:</b>   
        <br>

        <li>Camels can run at 25 mph (40 kph) for long periods. If their owner is in a hurry, they can kick their speed up to 40 mph (67 kph).</li>
        <br>
        <li>The camel's hump is like a storage container. When camels use their stored fat, their hump will diminish. When they eat and drink again the hump will refill with fat.</li>
       <br>
       <li>Camels have oval-shaped red blood cells that help continue blood flow during times when water is scarce.</li>
   <br>
   <li>
    Camels are known for spitting on people. In fact, the animals are throwing up the contents of their stomach along with spit. This is a defense tactic when the animals feel threatened.</li>
   <br>
   <li>The large beasts make a variety of moans, groans and deep, throaty bellows. One of the camel's noises was even used to voice the character Chewbacca in the Star Wars movies.</li>

    Origami : Chameleon
      <br>
      <hr color="black">
      <a href="http://origami.me/chameleon/"><img src="chameleon.png" class="center" style="float: right";/></a>

    Information:Chameleons are reptiles that are part of the iguana suborder. These colorful lizards are known as one of the few animals that can change skin color. 
    However, it is a misconception that chameleons change colors to match their surroundings.
    <br>
    <br>

    Size:
According to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), there are 171 species of chameleons. With so many different species, there are many different sizes. 
The largest chameleon is the Parson’s chameleon, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. It can grow up to 27 inches (69.5 centimeters) long. The Madagascan, also known as the Oustalet's chameleon, is also very large and grows up to 23 inches (60 cm) long.
The smallest chameleon has a special distinction. It is also one of the smallest vertebrates ever discovered. The leaf chameleon grows to just 0.5 inches (16 millimeters) and can sit comfortably on the head of a match.
<br>
<br>

Skin of many colors:
Changing skin color is an important part of communication among chameleons. According to the San Diego Zoo, a chameleon's skin changes colors in response to its emotions, such as anger or fear, changes in light, temperature or humidity.
The brighter the color, the more dominant the male is, and the more attractive he is to females. A submissive male is usually brown or gray. Females use their colors to accept or reject a suitor, and their color can also indicate that she is pregnant.
A new study has found that chameleons can rapidly change color by adjusting special cells, called iridophore cells, in each layer. The chameleons can change the structural arrangement of the upper cell layer by relaxing or exciting the skin, which leads to a change in color, researchers found. [Photos: How Chameleons Change Color]
<br>
<br>

Habitat:
Chameleons live in Madagascar, Africa, Spain, Portugal and Asia in rain forests, savannas, semi-deserts and steppes, according to the San Diego Zoo. 
They typically stay in trees or bushes, though some species do live on the ground. For example, the horned leaf chameleon lives in dead leaves on forest floors according to the 
National Wildlife Federation
<br>
<br>

Habits:
Most chameleons have a prehensile tail that they use to wrap around tree branches. Their hands and feet have large toes that help them cling to branches.
Besides changing skin color, chameleons have another feature that no other animals have. Their eyes can move independently of each other, enabling them to look in two different directions at once. Chameleons have a full 360-degree view and can focus their eyes quickly and enlarge what they are looking at like a camera lens. 
Chameleons are loners. In fact, most of the time females don't want males to even come near them. During the rare moments when the female is willing to be touched, the male will approach for mating. A brighter colored male chameleon is more likely to convince a female to mate than a duller colored male.
<br>
<br>

Diet:
Chameleons eat insects and birds. To catch their prey, they creep along very slowly. Once the prey is in reach, their suction cup tongue shoots out and sticks to the insect. Their tongues can be as twice as long as their bodies when stretched out to catch prey, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. The insect is drawn back into the lizard's mouth to be digested by strong stomach acids. 
Water is very important to chameleon growth and health. They either slurp water up using their tongues or the inhale it.
<br>
<br>

Offspring
Chameleons are different from many reptiles because some of the species, like the Jackson’s chameleon, have live births. These species can give birth to eight to 30 young at one time after a gestation of four to six months. While the young are born live instead of in an egg, they started as an egg. These mothers incubate the eggs, minus a shell, inside of her body instead of laying them in a nest.
Other chameleon species lay eggs that have an incubation period of four to 24 months, depending on species, according to the San Diego Zoo. The size of the chameleon predicts how many eggs she will lay. Small chameleon species lay two to four eggs while larger chameleons lay 80 to 100 eggs at one time.
No matter what species, chameleons become mature at 1 to 2 years of age. The exception is the Madagascan chameleon. It has been labeled as the vertebrate with the world's shortest life span, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. Their eggs hatch in November, the young become adults in January, they lay eggs in February, and then the entire adult population perishes after a lifespan of just three months.

<b>Facts:</b>   
        <br>

<li>Chameleons are a very unique branch of the lizard group of reptiles.</li>
<br>
<li>here are around 160 species of chameleon.</li>
<br>
<li>Chameleons live in warm varied habitats from rainforests through to deserts.</li>
<br>
<li>Almost half of the world's chameleon species are native to Madagascar, they are also found in Africa, and southern Europe to as far as Sri Lanka in Asia and have been introduced to Hawaii, California and Florida.</li>
<br>
<li>Special color pigment cells under the skin called chromatophores allow some chameleon species to change their skin color, creating combined patterns of pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, yellow and purple.</li>
<br>
<li>Chameleon change color for camouflage but this is not always the main reason. Some show darker colors when angry, or when trying to scare others. Males show light multi-colored patterns when vying for female attention. Desert varieties change to black when its cooler to absorb heat, then a light grey to reflect heat.</li>
<br>
<li>Chameleons have amazing eyes. The bulging upper and lower eyelids are joined and the pupil peaks out from a pinhole sized gap.</li>
<br>
<li>The chameleons' eyes can rotate and focus separately on 180-degree arcs, so they can see two different objects at the same time. This gives them a full 360-degree field of vision.</li>
<br>
<li>Chameleons actual eyesight is great they can see small insects 5-10 meters away. They can also see in both visible and ultraviolet light.</li>
<br>
<li>Chameleons feed by ballistically projecting their tongues often over twice the length of their body to catch prey, forming a suction cup as it hits its target.</li>
<br>
<li>The chameleons tongue can reach its prey in just 0.07 split seconds, with the projectile acceleration reaching over 41 g's of force.</li>
<br>
<li>Chameleons usually eat large insects such as locusts, grasshoppers, crickets, and stick insects, some bigger species also eat other lizards and young birds.</li>
<br>
<li>Chameleons are not deaf but they do not actually have ear openings.</li>
<br>
<li>Many species of chameleon have horn-like bumps or crests on their heads.</li>
<br>
<li>Species of chameleon can be as small as 15 mm (0.59 in) or as large as 69 cm (27 in).</li>
